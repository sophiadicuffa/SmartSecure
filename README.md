SmartSecure - 

SmartSecure addresses the pressing need for an innovative door lock system that seamlessly integrates the security attributes of traditional mechanical locks with the user-friendly convenience of modern technological locks. Our approach involves the utilization of Near Field Communication (NFC) technology to establish a secure connection between the resident's smartphone and the door lock, serving as the primary method for user authentication. 

Currently, the SmartSecure app includes a navigation drawer with toggle functionality. The options shown when the navigation drawer is selected are Home, Activity, Settings, Emergency, and Log Out. The code lays the foundation for future features, including connection to a Firebase backend, accurate activity log, and NFC communication to complete the app's capabilities.
